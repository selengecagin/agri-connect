Overview:
AgriConnect is a web application that provides a platform for farmers to create profiles, share their ideas, experiences, and experiments in agriculture. It includes discussion sections for each post, a marketplace for farming technology companies to sell their products and sponsor farmers, and a Q&A section for users to ask and answer questions.
